# Sound effect manipulation using FMOD.

A small showcase about the posible ways to manipulate a single sound file to achieve different feelings and how to implement these effects in FMOD. This prototype highlights different effects that are commonly used to enhance a sound and make it fit more for any given scenario.

### How to use:
This Unity project is a short showcase about use cases related to the manipulation of a single sound effect.
The project has a base sound file and through progressively adding different effects it shows what these effects can have on the overall feeling it creates.
Opening the project will give you two different views. One view tries to emulate a first person view for a simple game.
The second view is a more general overview which showcases some behind the scenes stuff.

In the prototype you can make the turtle walk from one side to the other side of the screen. This gives off a sound. However what sound it makes can make for a different experience.

The effects showcased in this prototype are:
* 3D audio mapping
* Audio attenuation
* EQ (Equalizing frequencies)
* Reverb
* Delay

### Controls:
* Numbers (1-6) are used to cycle between each different showcase. The effect showcased can be adjusted in real-time without any issues.
* The view can be switched from first person to the behind the scenes overview using "C".
* The player can press "LCtrl" to make the turtle move.

### Documentation:
Documentation regarding research and usage can be found on the wiki page of this repository.
