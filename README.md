# DeepDive-SFX-Manipulation

A showcase of different effects and ways to manipulate a single sound effect in order to achieve different results.

### How to use:
This Unity project is a short showcase about use cases related to the manipulation of a single sound effect.
The project has a base sound file and through progressively adding different effects it shows what these effects can have on the overall feeling it creates.
Opening the project will give you two different views. One view tries to emulate a first person view for a simple game.
The second view is a more general overview which showcases some behind the scenes stuff.

In the prototype you can make the turtle walk from one side to the other side of the screen. This ofcouse gives off a sound. However what sound it makes can make for a different experience.

The effects showcased in this prototype are:
* 3D audio mapping
* Audio attenuation
* EQ (Equalizing frequencies)
* Reverb
* Delay

### Controls:
* Numbers (1-6) are used to cycle between each different showcase. The effect showcased can be adjusted in real-time without any issues.
* The view can be switched from first person to the behind the scenes overview using "C".
* The player can press "LCtrl" to make the turtle move.

### Research:
General research related to the topics can be found on the wiki of this repository. The wiki is filled with certain devlogs that cover specific topics showcase as well as more general documentation.
