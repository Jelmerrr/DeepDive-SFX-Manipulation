# DeepDive-SFX-Manipulation

A showcase of different effects and ways to manipulate a single sound effect in order to achieve different results.


### How to use:
This Unity project is a short showcase about use cases related to the manipulation of a single sound effect.
The project has a base sound file and through progressively adding different effects it shows what these effects can have on the overall feeling it creates.
Opening the project will give you two different views. One view tries to emulate a first person view for a simple game.
The second view is a more general overview which showcases some behind the scenes stuff.

In the prototype you can make the turtle walk from one side to the other side of the screen. This ofcouse gives off a sound. However what sound it makes can make for a different experience.

The effects showcased in this prototype are:
* Audio Attenuation
* 3D audio mapping
* EQ (Equalizing frequencies)
* Reverb
* Delay
